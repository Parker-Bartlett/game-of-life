# Game of Life

Game of Life is a console application written in core java. It is based on John Horton Conway's cellular automaton, the `Game of Life`  

## Installation

Use [gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build the application. If using eclipse run the following command in your console.

```bash
gradle eclipse
```
Import project into eclipse

## Usage
Run `GameOfLife.java` as a java application and follow command prompts to see The Game of Life

## Testing
Open `BoardTest.java` and run as jUnit Test

## Overview
My version sticks to the core rules of The Game Of Life while using a test-driven approach in an object-oriented paradigm. I also added features to allow users to create their own board size and choose the number of generations they want to see.
